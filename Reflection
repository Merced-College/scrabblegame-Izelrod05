This assignment was a lot of fun, but definitely had its challenges. I really enjoyed building the Scrabble game logic and seeing everything come together, especially when checking if a word was valid or tracking the player’s score. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to load all the words from the text file into the list correctly. It took quite a bit of brainstorming and trial and error to get it working the way I wanted. I wasn’t totally sure how to handle reading each line and turning it into a Word object at first, but using GitHub Copilot really helped, Overall it was a fun assigment.
